Arithmetic Operators

Basic arithmetic often comes in handy when programming.

An operator is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in arithmetic operators, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:

    Add: +
    Subtract: -
    Multiply: *
    Divide: /
    Remainder: %
